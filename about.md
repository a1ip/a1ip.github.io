My name is Philippe Rigovanov. I am radical christian, baptist (TR Onlyist, not calvinist, not dispensationalist, supersessionist), also interested in Data Vizualisation, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Web Technologies.

You can find me here: <a href="{{ site.links.church }}" title="My Local Church">⛪</a>.
